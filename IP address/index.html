        <span>Thought process, how did I solve the task?</span>
        <ol>
            <li>At first, it was just one blurry text for me with no meaning at all.</li>
            <li>I started looking for any patterns in the text itself, but nothing came up.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed that the command was talking about 10 lines of text, but it still didn't look like lines, just an infinite string of characters. So I started adding more columns in excel to see how long the text was but it still seemed endless.</li>
            <li>So I decided to copy everything to notepad to see what it looks like without the styles imposed by excel. In the end, 10 separate paragraphs appeared to me.</li>
            <li>After a while, I realized that there must be a decoding pattern for this. That is, a string that will check whether there is a hidden IP in a given fragment of text.</li>
            <li>The idea itself came from the fact that a few days ago in JavaSscript I was writing a form with a pattern to check the correctness of the email address entered in the input.</li>
            <li>Finally, I decided to write a function that, based on the array, will check each paragraph to see if there is a hidden IP. As you can see above, we have the result.</li>
            <li>To confirm this, I invite you to visit my <a href="#"><b>github account</b></a>, where you can see what the source code looks like.</li>
